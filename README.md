# Guest & room
At the first I will talk about the guest. The guest has a first name, middle name and last name, SSN, gender, birthdate, phone number (many numbers), and we assign him an ID (PK) in the database. Because the guests are special, the hotel tracks their disability type so it can get him in the right room.

The hotel ensures that every single guest stays in the right room depending on his disability type. We also keep track of the availability of every room and the capacity. It also has an ID (PK). We also record the check-in, check-out date and the total price he will pay according to the duration he stayed. One guest stay (who makes the check-in) in one room.
